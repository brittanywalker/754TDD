1006,Xero currently isnt recording the expense part of salary sacrifice transactions correctly,1,133835
1007,At present the pre sacrifice amounts allocated to gross wages,0,133835
1008,I would expect the sacrificed amount should be allocated to the appropriate expense,0,133835
1009,For example where there is a gross wage of 1200 and 200 sacrificed for superannuation the gross wage of 1200 goes to wages expense and none of the sacrifice to superannuation expense,0,133835
1010,This means each monthquarteryear manual journals are needed to correct the allocation,0,133835
1011,This becomes more important with other types of salary sacrifice such as motor vehicles where GST applies,0,133835
1012,It would be good to add an expense account to pre tax deduction pay items that auto posts the debit to the appropriate expense and credit to the wages expense account,0,133835
1013,Alternatively if we have the option for the account in the payroll item to be more than just a liability account as is presently the case,0,133835
1014,This would at least allow the credit entry to be allocated against wages,0,133835
1015,This would then shows correct gross wages and allow the salary sacrifice expense to be managed separately,0,133835

1086,Except from what I can see its not just like the mobile app,0,134177
1087,In the mobile app the user can assign expenses just as Id expect any expense app to work by assigning them to a category meals  also to the account it was paid from ie a company credit card or by the employee etc,0,134177
1088,In the browser I see no way to select the account the expense was paid from and therefore no way for the approver to know how the transaction was even paid for,1,134177

1206,I understand that a credit note can be created but since the inventory has been reduced already I think applying the credit note might not work,3,125999
1207,Wondering if an invoice for the 10 widgets with a credit note is the answer,3,125999
1208,Or just an invoice,3,125999
1209,Or something else entirely,3,125999
1210,Thanks in advance for any ideas,4,125999

1234,My client sells pet foods so has different tax rates and needs to identify these for VAT purposes,0,138841
1235,Currently my client has a POS system that scans the barcode of the goods and feeds these direct to sage,0,138841
1236,Ideal is to have something very similar to this so as not to disrupt their business unnecessarily,0,138841
1237,Working in both the UK and Ireland we have staff i both locations,0,133559
1238,The full payroll features for the UK should be extended to included using Xero within Ireland,1,133559
1239,We have a client who sends a fixed price purchase order which is then used for a quarter,0,126417
1240,Is there a way to track how much of a clients PO has been billed through Xero,3,126417
1241,I was looking at the quote feature but not sure how this would fit the bill,1,126417
1242,I have a private loan registered under 900 ï¿½ Loan in the chart of accounts,0,126047
1243,Theres no interest on the loan,0,126047
1244,Question 1Company capital from loan,0,126047
1245,One part of this loan is to pay a thirdparty to set up the company,0,126047
1246,The other part lets say 50 to keep it simple is capital to be put into the company,0,126047

1252,Hi communityIm new to Xero and very much new to accounting as well oh the joys,0,136009
1253,I have setup my PayPal feed and it has imported all the transaction lines correctly,0,136009
1254,However the transaction lines pull in the gross value which excludes the paypal fees,1,136009
1255,How do i show that i have had a fee on certain transactions in Xero,3,136009
1256,What i done on my previous system was every month tally up the paypal fees and add an entry of that value,0,136009
1257,What is recommended,3,136009
1258,Hi everyoneI appreciate that this basic question might be beyond the scope of the forum but Im trying to inform HMRC of the fact that this is the end of year PAYE submission,0,125493
1259,Theres a KB article on the Xero site which in turn sends me to a YouTube video from the HMRC about ticking a box on a page in the HMRC portal to tell them that the most recent submission was the last of the year but I cant see that anywhere,1,125493
1260,Given that the video is a bit old am I to assume that Xero will inform HMRC that this PAYE submission is the last of the year,3,125493
1261,Im confused as to how that last piece of the puzzle works,0,125493
1262,Ive done my PAYE reconciling and worked through the list of check points in the Xero article,0,125493
1263,Theres only me on the payroll so I cant imagine that anything can go too wrong,0,125493
1264,ThanksOlly,4,125493
1265,Good morningI wanted to give some feedback on one of the connected apps Veeqo,0,138890
1266,This is an inventory management company and having investigated all of the apps this one came out the best for price and features,0,138890
1267,Unfortunately Veeqo is massively let down by the lack of customer service and knowledge that the staff have,1,138890
1268,We have had many issues since we started to use Veeqo and these have been addressed by the staff,0,138890
1269,However it is incredibly time consuming to get a response impossible to speak to someone by phone and became evident that although we went through several induction sessions to discuss the workings of our business Veeqo had not understood our requirements,0,138890
1270,The planned meetings we had with various members of staff were regularly late commencing and on occasion did not happen at all,1,138890
1271,The response to this was These thing happen in businessFinally when I tried to submit a complaint it proved impossible to speak to a manger and after over a week of constant emails from us we finally receive a response that accepts no responsibility and no solution,0,138890
1272,I have worked with many Xero connected apps and as a rule they have all been successful the companies have been helpful and staff incredibly knowledgeable and forthcoming,0,138890
1273,Most importantly I have always been able to get hold of someone if there have been any issues,0,138890
1274,We have now moved to a new Inventory control system slightly more expensive and have already seen a massive improvement in service,0,138890
1275,I am positive as with most things people have had positive experiences with Veeqo however I wanted to provide feedback for anyone else who is looking for an Inventory add on,0,138890
1276,Thanks,4,138890
1277,HelloAs my employees do not know the business nor my twelve month plan,0,137507
1278,I prefer that a face to face discussion with myself takes place in the future in regards putting in for leave,0,137507
1279,Once we have agreed and discussed all the pros and cons then I would like to enter it in to the Leave section,0,137507
1280,At the moment It has given them to much control to discuss and organise their lives around each other without knowing any fundamentals of what is expected at those times of the business and without and consultation,1,137507
1281,Way to much chit chat already about the Easter break,1,137507
1282,After the fact puts me in an awkward situation and it was never like that until these portals arrived,0,137507
1283,I would like pop up options for admin that has a block effect in this case,0,137507
1284,That says Your employer ass per company policy will need to speak to you before holidayLeave entry times are requested,0,137507
1285,Thank you Fabian,4,137507
1286,In California  and perhaps other states  goods which are purchased for resale are exempt from Sales Tax on that purchase,0,126360
1287,However some vendors charge tax at the time of sale because they arent set up to handle resale customers,0,126360
1288,In this case the sales taxes paid on goods for resale may be used as an offset against sales tax liability the forwarding of sales taxes collected on goods sold to the taxing authority,0,126360
1289,How should I set up Xero so when I pay sales taxes on goods purchased for resale I can see those amounts on my sales tax report and properly deduct them from my sales tax liability,3,126360
1290,We are considering using Xero as a replacement for our existing bespoke system,0,128513
1291,The guidelines suggest Xero is suitable for 200500 invoice per month,0,128513
1292,Has anybody any experience of posting more invoices and what happens,3,128513
1293,Hi all I have two basic questions that I was unable to locate in a search,0,125471
1294,1 When importing goods from overseas I am reconciling the transaction at this point without GST,0,125471
1295,Do I record this as No Tax or Tax Exclusive,3,125471
1296,2 I am paying the GST as the goods arrive into NZ customs thus there is a separate transaction for the GST alone,0,125471
1297,How do I reconcile this,3,125471
1298,Can I reconcile this as the 820 GST Liability,3,125471
1299,Thanks in advance from a small business owner ,4,125471
1300,How do I split or apportion depreciation expense over various teams using the AutoDepreciate feature in the FAR,3,127153
1301,It seems you can only allocate one team when setting up the asset in the FAR,0,127153
1302,Xero has not been prompting for any payroll tax because my scorp has not paid any payroll this year yet to its employee myself self employed,0,128193
1303,I am in state of Virginia USA,0,128193
1304,Do I need to file a form pay business state and federal income tax on a quarterlymonthly basis for what my corporation has been generating income every month,3,128193
1305,Or will it be due annually when filed if owed,3,128193
1306,A client of mine has been using the new discount feature on sales invoices which is a really handy feature the problem is that the discount does not appear in the standard docx template,1,136590
1307,We have not modified this template in any way so I would have expected this to show up as a line item somewhere,0,136590
1308,Discounts do show up on the regular non docx branding theme,0,136590
1309,Am I missing something or do Xero need to modify their docx documents to present discounting,3,136590
1310,Many thanksSean,4,136590
1311,I am trying to find a way to separate the invoices and packing slips so that when I use Print PDF it prints both but when I email I can just email the invoice and not the packing slip,1,128792
1312,I am getting some confused customers wondering why they get a copy of the packing slip everytime I email the invoice,0,128792
1313,Hi thereWe have some staff paid monthly and one staff member in particular has a few leave requests throughout the month,0,137363
1314,Each leave period shows as a separate line on his payslip,0,137363
1315,The payslip looks messy with the multiple leave lines with nothing to differentiate them apart from the number of hours taken and even some of those figures are the same,1,137363
1316,Is there a way to just make it show as one line or to get details of the leave dates added,3,137363
1317,ThanksCandice,4,137363
1318,Hello everyoneWe have done our payroll on Xero for the first time in April 2015,0,137990
1319,We noticed that the Employment Allowance is not deducted from the PAYE due payable to HMRC automatically,1,137990
1320,Xero noted that we need to make a journal entry to be able to claim this,0,137990
1321,The relevant boxes have been ticked as required,0,137990
1322,How do we do this and how do we know the exact amount to be deducted,3,137990
1323,Any comments is greatly appreciated,4,137990
1324,Many kind regardsSylet,4,137990
1325,HiWhen renting our office we paid a security deposit,0,127493
1326,How do i record that in Xero so that we get reminded at the end of the lease to collect it,3,127493
1327,We would like to set up a control,0,127493
1328,Best,4,127493
1329,Hi thereWe have just migrated over to Xero from Free Agent and have noticed we have a tonne of sales invoices listed under our awaiting payment tab that arent marked as sent,0,135426
1330,However when I go into the invoice detail it says awaiting payment,1,135426
1331,Can I therefore assume that these HAVE been sent even though its not marked as such and that I dont need to resend these again,3,135426
1332,FYI these mainly seem to relate to recurring invoices,0,135426
1333,Ive also checked under history and notes section but its not listed here either,0,135426
1334,Any info gratefully received,4,135426
1335,If employees do not have hours in this payrun should I delete the timesheet for them before I process the payrun,3,137883
1336,If I leave them intact I havent input to them the pay run generates a small payment for them due to tax refund,1,137883
1337,In Sage I would have set these to On Hold this week,0,137883
1339,HiOur Employees like many other companies in Australia can accrue a maximum of 76 hours personal leave once they have reached the 76 we should be able to set a ceiling so it accrues no further,0,136911
1340,Resetting to 0 annually doesnt work as an employee who hasnt taken any time off is still entitled to their 76 hours,1,136911
1341,Example Jim has been working for Company A for 14 months he hasnt had any time off for personalcarers leave he gets sick and needs 3 days off so his personal leave balance should reflect 532 hours and start accruing again at the weekly rate of 14615 until it again reaches 76 hours,0,136911
1342,Without a ceiling the accrual is not reflective of actual entitlements and we need to manually go back through the last 12 months for an employee and see how many hours they have taken and subtract that from amount accrued in that period and add the balance accrued before that period,1,136911
1343,Or we need to make a manual adjustment every week for employees who have reached the maximum,1,136911
1344,Its all very messy and could be easily fixed with a settable ceiling,0,136911
1345,HiMy inventory items dont show in bills,1,134413
1346,They show in invoices on the customer side and in the inventory list itself but theyre not available for use in bills  theres nothing there at all,1,134413
1347,Anyone got any ideas on this one please,3,134413
1348,RegardsDave,4,134413
1349,HelloMy client just change from MYOB to XERO but I am a new XEROS user so I am a bit confuse about how to manage some accounts,0,128373
1350,My client has 2 businesses and he pays bills from any of the businesses accounts so we are managing it as a intercompanies loans,0,128373
1351,In MYOB we had set up a credit car account for the intercompanies loan,0,128373
1352,When the company paid others company bills we did spend money from the bank account and increase the loan account balance,0,128373
1353,When the other companys paid an expense of this company then we transfer the money to the credit card and decrease the balance,0,128373
1354,When we received a payment in this account that was other companys service we did a receive money and decrease the balance,0,128373
1355,We did something similar with ATO Integrated account,0,128373
1356,We created a credit card account then spend money when we need to enter the GST PYG interest etc and transfer money when the payments were done,0,128373
1357,I was able to reconciled it with the ATO statements,0,128373
1358,Could I work in the same way in XERO or it looks as a messy books if the  credit card accounts are not reconciled in the Loan case,3,128373
1359,How best does one offset an equal debtor and creditor balance that is due tofrom the same entity,3,127746
1360,I want to sell a fixed asset to an entity at Net Book Value to a connected party,0,127746
1361,Having followed the help section this will raise a sales invoice  nil profit and raise a trade debtor,0,127746
1362,That same party will also bill me separately a management fee for the same amount,0,127746
1363,This means there will be no cash or VAT impact on either party,0,127746
1364,However it does leave me with a Trade Creditor and a Trade Debtor of equal amounts,1,127746
1365,How best do I offset these to keep my Xero accounts clean,3,127746
1366,As background info  Im winding down a company and want to clear out the balance sheet,0,127746
1367,httpscommunityxerocombusinessdiscussion37280114Kinda similar to this chapI too have only JUST started using Xero  and this is my first kinda of accounting software as Im VERY new to thisOk,0,134977
1368,Ive done my best to go through as much as possible on the software and Ive jumped on in and attempted to swim along,0,134977
1369,However i THEN found out  noticed I needed to enter in starting balances etc etc to begin with and I basically didnt do this,0,134977
1370,1 Ive basically done the following,0,134977
1371,Ive imported my HSBC cvs bank statements from July  1 2014 to Jun 30th  Our Financial Year 2 Ive reconciled the statements with the sales and purchases and naturally a report has been produced,0,134977
1372,3 Everything seemed to me seemed ok on the reports4 My accountant has access to this now to make life easier which is what swung me toward using the software as I like the mobile functionality of which I KNOW i can pass on and teach to my colleagues within the business just to help streamline things on a daily basis and stay completely upto date,0,134977
1373,5 My accountant has informed me of my balances from my previous accounting year though I was going on my bank statement itself 6 So I entered them into Conversion Balance section but apparently still things are not right,1,134977
1374,Am I doing something wrong ,3,134977
1375,should I start again id rather not as Ive reconciled things in details even giving descriptions on many itemsalso my Xero Balanced dont seem to match up eitherI hope someone can help me as I really dont want to be now going back to excel as this looks like great software,0,134977
1376,Hope this makes sense,4,134977
1377,Hi thereWhat information do I need to work out whether a 3rd party software will link into Xero,3,139606
1378,I am look at a lease management software which as a feature has an accounting link allowing information to be exchanged especially accounts payable,0,139606
1379,RegardsPatrick,4,139606
1380,Trying to post payroll this afternoon and when I went to approve the timesheets I get the error messageAn error has occured Your Payslip may be out of sync Try again in a moment,1,138130
1381,I have been retrying for an hour now,0,138130
1382,I have logged a support request but the response time to that is potentially 24hrs and I would like to pay the staff today,0,138130
1383,Has anyone come across this error and a potential fixworkaround,3,138130
1384,HelloI am looking for either a business owner or accountant who is familiar with and knows in detail the pros and cons of how certain programs work with Xero and can offer advice on a possible solution,0,139038
1385,I am starting a new business in the UK and i want to sell both retail online and wholesale in person,0,139038
1386,I have picked Xero as my accounts package Shopify as my online solution and i am wondering if i can run my business on just that or if i need a inventory app also,3,139038
1451,Now under my Settings  Superannuation I got 2 super funds that I added in,0,136854
1387,Here are the key issues I import 100 from overseas with long lead times so working out costings and creating purchase orders and Invoices months in advance is a question,0,139038
1388,Is Xero a good program as central data file for products,3,139038
1389,Does this info flow to shopify or do i need to duplicate data,3,139038
1390,Are the basic apps for shopify any good for linking to Ebay and Amazon,3,139038
1391,I dont have a warehouse or staff i plan to contract out all logistics to a 3PL,0,139038
1392,I have been looking at inventory apps such as Deer Unleashed Trade Gecko or Cin7,0,139038
1393,Cost is a factor but it would be great to talk to someone who has used any of these with Xero and offer advice,0,139038
1394,Many ThanksNathan,4,139038
1395,Right sick of Xero payroll,0,140003
1396,Can anyone please recommend a payroll addon that is not too expensive,3,140003
1397,Thank you,4,140003
1398,For small business clients there should be option for calculating depreciation and disposal and addition for pooled assets,0,128480
1399,Rules are quite different from normal diminishing value method hence we have to prepare manual workpaper to calculate depreciation and have to post it manually,1,128480
1400,Xero Payroll does not calculate wages based on the employees start date,1,133937
1401,If your employee starts halfway through a pay run pay period a manual adjustment of their hours and tax will need to be done,1,133937
1402,For example,0,133937
1403,1 We use a monthy pay cycle that ends 28th of each month,0,133937
1404,2 We have setup a new employee set the start date as 5th November 2012,0,133937
1405,3 We have setup employee with annual salary based of 40 hours work week,0,133937
1406,4 When we do a pay run xero calculates the employee worked 23 days worth of hours instead of 18,0,133937
1407,It has thus NOT taken into account their start date but used the entire month,0,133937
1408,I can work around the problem by adjusting the number of hours after doing a pay run but this is clearly undesirable and error prone especially as wage costs are a large part of our business and getting these wrong is costly,0,133937
1409,Hi I have a case of new fixed asset where 03 payments were made on different dates to buy the same item,0,127511
1410,01 Downpayment  paid thru Debit Card on 1st of May,0,127511
1411,02 1st partial payment  paid thru Credit Card on 15th of May,0,127511
1412,03 Final payment  paid thru EFT on 20th of May,0,127511
1413,Under fixed assets these three transactions are appearing as 03 different assets,1,127511
1414,How do I combine them into 01 Asset,3,127511
1415,Appreciate any reference or solution,4,127511

1417,Hi,0,134704
1418,Im switching my bank account to The Cooperative Bank UK and I see theres a feed available for Personal Banking which I need,0,134704
1419,Every time I try to set up the feed Xero tells me that the access to my online banking is locked,1,134704
1420,On contacting The Cooperative Bank they tell me they have updated their online banking system so that the questions that Xero asks will no longer be acceptable,0,134704
1421,Could you look into this please as I really need to set this feed up as soon as possible,3,134704
1422,It seems the questions you need to ask are different and I do know the answers,0,134704
1423,Many thanks,4,134704
1424,Hey GuysI recently added some funds into my business account as my cash flow was running low and then within a few weeks transfered the same amount back to my personal account,0,127502
1425,How do I account for this on Xero as the transaction appear on the  bank feeds,3,127502
1426,ThanksKet,4,127502
1427,I used some convenience checks from a credit card to pay some vendors,0,126366
1428,Xero excludes ALL credit card transactions and PayPal transactions,0,126366
1429,After some research it appears as though these transactions do no meet the definition of purchase card transaction and as such would not be reported by the PSE Payment Settlement Entity ie the credit card company on a form 1099K,0,126366
1430,Seems like Xero needs to add a check box somewhere that would allow these transactions to flow into the 1099 query reporthttpwwwmarcumllpcomblogtaxandbusinessnewform1099kfilingrequirementformerchantcardandthirdpartynetworkpayments,1,126366

1439,Hi I have only been using xero for a few months and have just noticed that on our profit an loss statement the wages figures are showing up twice once as a net figure and once as a gross figure and therefore throwing out our monthly figures,1,136815

1442,I am coming from Quickbooks and I am setting up my chart of accounts,0,126837
1443,I am not familiar with setting a tax rate for each account,0,126837
1444,For example I have a computer sales account I need to add to record our computer sales in,0,126837
1445,With Quickbooks I  normally would just set sales tax 7 per invoice or per item I was selling and the item would be tied to the correct sales account,0,126837
1446,Do I need to set a tax rate on the actual account if I set tax rate for the item or can I just leave it at zero,3,126837

1458,Some of the guys in company are longterm contractors so they are not in ï¿½Employeesï¿½ list in Xero in this case how do I handle super for them in the system,3,136854

1460,When a supplier requires a deposit up front with the balance to be paid on delivery how can duplicate fixed assets in Xero be avoided,3,133954
1461,We recently ordered custom computer equipment and paid a deposit upon ordering,0,133954
1462,This transaction created a new fixed asset in Xero that I have since registered,0,133954
1463,Weve now paid the balance owing and this 2nd transaction has created a duplicate fixed asset record,0,133954
1464,I will probably delete the new fixed asset but would like to be able to have both the deposit and balance payment transactions linked to the asset record,0,133954
1465,Is this possible in Xero,3,133954
1466,We have set our default to be Tax Inclusive on our sales invoices but see when we start a new invoice it reverts to Tax Exclusive,1,139941

1494,Is it just me being a Xero novice or is there a way to show a VAT summary table consisting of TaxCode NetGoodsAmount and TaxTotal on a custom invoice using just the default currency,3,126642
1495,It seems that Xero will do exactly what I want using the Currency Conversion table but only when the invoice is in a foreign currency,0,126642
1496,I would like to have a very similar table on invoices using just the default currency,0,126642
1497,Is this the Achilles heel of Xero,3,126642
1498,In my previous accounting package that will remain nameless I had a VAT summary table on all my invoices It was impossible to get rid of it,0,126642
1499,Nearly every invoice I look at from my suppliers shows the VAT rate the net total amount it applies to and the corresponding tax total in a table,0,126642
1500,So what am I doing wrong that means all I can show in Xero is the Tax Code and its Tax Total,3,126642
1501,I know legally it might not be essential but its almost a courtesy to whomever has to handle the paperwork,0,126642
1502,I have asked Xero support but as yet had no reply,0,126642
1503,Is there anyone in the Xero community that can put me straight please,3,126642

1520,Through this tax year weve accidentally been using owner funds introduced  owner drawings  directors loan account to record personal money in and out,0,134960
1521,Were a ltd company so I want to use just the directors loan account and therefore need to consolidate owners funds introduced and owner drawings into the DLA,0,134960
1522,I suppose I could go into each of the transactions mostly expense claims undo the payments and recode them to the DLA but this would take some time and every adjustment i would assume will appear on our latest VAT return,1,134960
1523,Is it possible  advised to just make lump sum transfers from the 2 owners accounts into the DLA,3,134960

1527,I have a large fixed asset register and 9 months into the tax year it is not feasible to rollback depreciation to the beginning of the year just so that I can dispose of an asset without incurring depreciation in the current year,1,126374
1528,There have been other disposals and journals created during the course of the year and repeating the disposal of these assets is not an option,0,126374
1529,This was not a problem prior to the November 2015 improvements,0,126374

1545,Hi My client runs a business in the clothing industry supplying clothing to schools clubs and businesses,0,126368
1546,I have set up 2 tracking categories Size and Colour  to allow him to use these specifically for invoicing customers,0,126368
1547,This is a great feature as he can make an appropriate selection on screen while invoicing,0,126368
1548,My client wants the tracking category of Size and Colour to appear the invoice to his customers,0,126368
1549,It would appear the tracking category field names are not available to customise the invoice or I just havent found them,1,126368

1555,I cannot find how to achieve this so hope someone can help,1,125477
1556,Multiple payments 2 were made to a supplier for a number of products 3 received because a difference payment had to be made a few days later but before I was invoiced to account for a change to a superior product,0,125477
1557,These 2 payments are showing up as separate lines in my company credit card account ready for reconciliation,0,125477
1558,Using the three separate invoices that correctly show the 3 products I received from the supplier I created a transaction made up of the 3 items which totalled the same spent value as the 2 credit card account statement lines however there is no option to split this transaction like there is with invoice payments that I can see,1,125477
1559,Therefore when I choose match against either of the statement lines I can see the transaction but cannot proceed,1,125477
1560,Please advise if this requires the implementation of additional functionality or if I should undertake this reconciliation using a different process,3,125477

1617,Ive had a search for this and there are three treads which seem to discuss a similar thing however each are missing one key fact,0,128337
1618,Firstly the background,0,128337
1619,We use Workflow Max to generate an invoice and that automatically gets fed into Xero as a draft,0,128337
1620,All ok from here,0,128337
1621,Then we adjust in Xero where appropriate if needed and then send the invoice as an email WITHIN Xero using the following options selected not sure if that has anything to so with this issue but giving the full workflowInclude files as attachments YESInclude PDF attachment YESSend me a copy accountscouk YESThis goes off to the client and I receive my copy into my outlook inbox so the invoice has definitely been sent,0,128337
1622,HOWEVER and this is where it gets odd,0,128337
1623,When I look down my list of invoices sent out in the Invoices Awaiting Payment page it clearly shows that the most recent invoices not as being sent IE the word Sent in green is not showing besides it in the list,1,128337
1624,If I select the invoice and select its history it clearly shows three things for exampleCreated17 Nov 2015 1107 am System GeneratedReceived through the Xero API from WorkflowMax Invoice sent 17 Nov 2015 1130 am Shake AccountsThis invoice has been sent to DavidcoukApproved17 Nov 2015 1131 am Shake Accounts INV6212 to  Ltd for 1639999,0,128337
1625,So everything is showing that it appeared in Xero from Workflow Max was sent via email within Xero and then was approved by me,0,128337
1626,Surely if it goes through the process of sending the invoice it should mark it as sent as everything apart from the initial import is done within Xero,1,128337
1627,We do generate invoices directly within Xero too and we get the same issue,0,128337
1628,I must stress this never affects clients paying they always receive the invoices so that is not the issue the problem is the invoices are simply not showing as sent in searches,0,128337
1629,Any help greatly appreciated,4,128337

1714,The situation is staff are salaried annual amounthours  hourly rate however they are paid monthly in arrears last day of the month for the actual number of days worked and not simply Annual salary  12 months,0,136890
1715,The issue is their leave needs to be calculated monthly Based on Ordinary Earnings for the month and not just 152 hours  12 months,0,136890
1716,When I try and put this into Xero AU Payroll it tells I have to insert a monthly amount of leave calculated,1,136890

1721,I hope someone here can help me,0,135985
1722,My accountant set up my bank feeds for me,0,135985
1723,One of them is the situation where only the person who set up the feed can refresh it,0,135985
1724,This bank feed fails all the time and every time like a pest I have to email my accountant to refresh the feed for me,1,135985
1725,Both my accountant and I would prefer it if I could refresh the feed,0,135985
1726,I understand that only the one who added the feed can refresh it  how can I be that person instead of my accountant,3,135985
1727,If I am the only one who can refresh it that is perfectly fine,0,135985
1728,Its just a hassle when SHE is the only one who can refresh it,1,135985
1729,So is there any way to switch that over,3,135985
1730,Ive tried looking around in Xero to figure out if I can reenter the bank feed info so that then I will be the special person with the permissions but I havent been able to find any way to do that,0,135985
1731,Suggestions,3,135985

1735,We would love to find fellow Xero users in our supply chain and would even consider changing certain suppliers to Xero users for ease of use,0,134965
1736,Trouble is there is not a subtle way of finding out who uses Xero,1,134965

1738,I have a client who operates his payroll for two shops,0,133597
1739,It would be a good feature to be able to show the address of the location the employee works on the payslip rather than a single location for all,0,133597
1740,Its very common to invoice 50 of an invoice first and then on final invoice theres the next 50 and possibly additional expenses,0,135374
1741,PLEASE XERO can you add this feature whereby I can deduct an amount already receivedinvoiced,3,135374
1742,It would help a lot,0,135374
1743,Instead I have to manually create another invoice to do this which completely defeats the purpose of having XERO in the first place,1,135374

1751,I have just completed my first financial year and am confused about how to account for Corporation Tax in Xero,0,125435
1752,I have submitted my tax return and just paid the tax due to HMRC,0,125435
1753,I have reconciled the bank transaction so that now I have an Expense sitting against account 500  Corporation Tax,0,125435
1754,In my Profit and Loss for 201617 the expense against code 500 is now shown as an operating expense and reduces down the net profit for the year,1,125435
1755,Is there any way of separately showing net profit BEFORE tax and having the Corporation Tax expense sitting between net profit BEFORE tax and net profit AFTER tax,3,125435
1756,ThanksBen,4,125435
1757,I have completed all of the payroll enrolment details in Payroll settings but Xero is not selecting any staff to be included in auto enrolment,1,137779
1758,All of them are eligible by my reckoning but none are selected,1,137779
1759,On the Employee tab under Eligibility Status the box is greyed out,1,137779
1760,I am clearly missing something but after assessing this forum and the videos I am no clearer what I am missing,1,137779

1769,HI I have been using xero for 6 months and on the whole it is fantastic,0,128095
1770,One thing that i would like to see is the credit invoices issued by suppliers to be able to be manually ticked against a payment rather than allocating it to another invoice,1,128095
1771,As a lot of our credit notes do not correspond with invoices from the supplier and it then becomes difficult for suppliers to match off our invoices from our remittances,1,128095
1772,Also the fact that each time you load an invoice onto a supplier that has a credit note a reminder comes up that there is a credit note available,1,128095
1773,this in turn seems to stop the flow of creating another bill as it takes you to that invoice if you dont allocate this credit,1,128095
1774,Looking forward to your reply,4,128095

1790,I am struggling to sort out the best way to handle reconciling two transactions I have in Xero,0,135142
1791,I have two separate vendors who issued partial refunds after a purchase was made,0,135142
1792,One was because we were charged too much for shipping and the other because we were charged for an upgrade that we did not end up using,0,135142
1793,Both of the original expenses were one off expenses paid via credit card and do not have associated bills,0,135142
1794,They were just reconciled along with other bank transactions,0,135142
1795,How do I handle the refunds,3,135142
1796,They dont seem to be overpayments and I dont have a bill to create a credit note against,1,135142
1797,I could create bills but is that a best practice,3,135142
1798,If I just choose to reconcile it and label is as vendor refund is it categorized as an asset or as revenue,3,135142
1799,Any guidance would be very much appreciated Thanks,0,135142
1800,Hi there â€ I am starting a business that is pretty straightforward wholesale distribution,0,126593
1801,Payments will mostly come in via check but many customers will pay via credit card,0,126593
1802,I love the idea of being able to email an invoice to a customer with a big PAY NOW button which will let them simply input their CC details secureley and pay their invoice,0,126593
1803,This is a new venture for me though and Im admittedly ignorant on the details and variables I should be considering when making this,1,126593
1804,Which service should I integrate,3,126593
1805,How do the services that integrate with Xero compare to setting up Merchant Services through my bank,3,126593

1807,Hi thereWe use Capital On Tap as a regular loans service,0,126082
1808,There is no option for bank feeds and the loan is paid in as and when we require it almost like a transfer from a separate account with a loan limit,0,126082
1809,We then have to pay back a minimum amount every month depending on the cumulative total we have loaned at the end of that month so the amount is never fixed always variable,0,126082
1810,I ideally want to record the capital we have received ad hoc the amount we have paid back monthly and the interest as an expense,0,126082
1811,The loan was started before we began using Xero so I realise I will need to enter a conversion balance,0,126082
1812,But I was wondering if anyone had any idea on how to go about recording the payments in the repayments out and the interest,3,126082
1813,Would I need to create two accounts one for loan and one for loan interest,3,126082
1814,I hope this makes sense and thanks in advance for any help or light you can shed on this,4,126082
1815,Many thanksJoe,4,126082
1816,Im just starting to reconcile after adding Kounta integration and am not sure how to handle cash purchases made from the cash register,0,139105
1817,If a supplier is paid cash on delivery from the till the deducted cash is recorded as cash out showing the reduced cash in the till,0,139105
1818,How do I record this invoice paid by cash in Xero,3,139105
1819,The Kounta integration only shows the reduced cash in cash register clearing account not the COGS account,1,139105
1820,When you receive a purchase order in Kounta it doesnt appear to allow you to specify how the invoice was paid,1,139105

1827,We currently use CBUS clearing account however the CSV file they require every month is not downloadable from Xero,1,137054
1828,Does anyone else upload a file direct from Xero to a clearing house,3,137054
1829,I tried to use the auto option in Xero through Click Super but as I need receipts to send to customers and neither Click or Xero can offer any reporting this is a dead end,1,137054
1830,Any suggestions,3,137054
1831,We currently use Xero and are now in the process of finding a suitable POS and Stock control system,0,139449
1832,Ideally the POS system we would like touch screen based suitable for staff with limited computer skills or even iPad as we    could operate with more than one sales counter Our stock is varied from standard hardware  building lines  through to Animal health and stock feedso we need to be able to sell in the same item in different formats bulk and per metre  or per KG  or single unitsWe do run monthly accounts for customers as well,0,139449

1834,HiWe have some suppliers who have up to 70 invoices required for paymentTo avoid having to enter these all individually we create one purchase for the supplier,0,134058
1835,and in the body of the purchase enter all the invoices Of course we are unable to list every invoice number in the reference box so we call it by the month of statement,0,134058
1836,It makes it very easy then to identity pick up  batch all bills that need to be paid at the end of the month as they all have the same reference,0,134058
1837,This works fine for us but we do get requests from our suppliers as to what invoices we are paying as the remittance only says April 17 Statement,1,134058
1838,Is there anyway to send a remittance with the body of the purchase showing,3,134058

1848,I followed the forum posts and set up the account code and put through as credit notes but Im told this isnt what they want,1,125232
1849,Is it possible to put through a bad debt differently such a journal entry on an accrual scheme so that we can claim the VAT back but stillleave the invoices open in case we do eventually get payments in,3,125232
1850,We want to still be able to send statements etc if requested but adding a credit note to the invoices means that we are not able to do this as theyre down as paid,0,125232
1851,Hi thereWe dont raise Xero invoices for our occasional suppliers instead well simply create the transactions at reconciliation timeadding a new contact as necessary,0,128746
1852,My question is   whats the easiest way to search for these transactions by contact name,3,128746
1853,I had a case this morning where I needed to quickly add a file to a historical transaction for a known contact and I had to do the following Start at the dashboard Click on Accounts  Bank Accounts Click the correct bank account Click the Transactions tab Click Search enter the contact nameClick the appropriate transaction from the list that appears,0,128746
1854,Thats quite laborious and also involves knowing which bank account the transaction belongs to,1,128746

1856,I tried instead to do it via the Contacts page searched and found the correct contact but there didnt seem to be a link to click through and view alltransactions associated with that contact,1,128746

1892,Hi thereAt the moment we use the demo environment,0,44624
1893,However have three problems with it,1,44624
1894,One of them is that it does not contain our production data and the second one is that it expires after 30 days,1,44624
1895,The third problem is that it is bound to one account which makes it harder for the developers to share one demo environment to test,1,44624
1896,Does Xero support a sandbox environment or an environment which is a copy of production,3,44624
1897,Or is it possible to keep the demo environment alive for more then 30 days including the sharing of the demo account,3,44624
1898,Thanks and RegardsKeethanjan,4,44624
1899,Im wondering if there is any way to limit the number of results returnedfor example an equivalent to SELECT TOP 100 in SQLWe intend to create about 800 invoices per month via the API and all of them will be created on the same day and have the same invoice date and due date so I dont think we could use any date fields or if modified since to limit the results,3,46320
1900,  When issuing a GET request on these ideally wed be able to split it up into 8 different API calls ie,1,46320
1901,in the following pseudo codetRequest 1 of 8 Get the top 100 records where invoice date is 20120402T000000 order by UpdatedDateUTCtRequest 2 of 8 Get the top 100 records where invoice date is 20120402T000000 and UpdatedDateUTC  the last UpdatedDateUTC in Request 1 order by UpdatedDateUTCtAnd so on until there are no more records retrievedt,2,46320
1902,Is there any way either to limit the records returned or some other way to split up this request into multiple API calls,3,46320

1911,I find the new Net library extremely unintuitive and convoluted,1,45062
1912,Even looking at the example implementations it is not a quick or easy thing to tease out the best way to implement and utilise this myself,1,45062
1913,I look forward to a straightforward library with straightforward example code of how to implement it,1,45062
1914,IMHO 9 arguments for a constructor is too many see PartnerMvcAuthenticator in the example code,1,45062
1915,Hello Ive got problem when trying to exchange request token to access token sending request to oauthAccessToken,1,47098
1916,First step was completed successfuly and I redirected myself to APIAuthoriseaspx page where I authorized my app to access my account,0,47098
1917,After redirecting me back to callback url I always get oauthproblemsignatureinvalidoauthproblemadviceFailed20to20validate20signature response from oauthAccessToken,1,47098
1918,Here are data I send and receiveThis code is provided by the developer community  Xero does not warrant it in any wayIm pretty sure that signature is made correctly ,0,47098
1919,I use OAuthSimple class provided in one of Xeros code samples,0,47098
1920,Full sample works correctly the problem appears when I try to attach the library into our application,1,47098
1921,Its the newest version available,0,47098
1922,HiI am using the Xero API and sending a HTTP GET request from my application to Xero to return Contacts that match a certain Name,0,45761
1923,Sousing instructions from httpdeveloperxerocomdocumentationgettingstartedhttprequestsandresponsestitle3 I send for example NameA Company Ltd urlencoded as part of the URL,0,45761
1924,This works fine until I search on a Name that includes a double quote in it,1,45761
1925,Does anyone know how to get it to work and Xero to not return an error when a double quote exists,3,45761
1926,I know its highly unlikely that a Name would have a double quote in it but its always best to make an application as robust as possible in my opinion no matter how unlikely,0,45761
1927,Many thanks in advanceCheersRhyd,4,45761
1928,Im trying to return all Invoices for June 2013 NOT just those that have been changed since a certain date,0,45185
1929,I can see how the API documentation handles this situation it says to use the following value for the where parameter from httpdeveloperxerocomapioverviewhttprequestsandresponsesgetfiltered,0,45185
1930,FullyPaidOnDate  DateTime2011 10 01 AND FullyPaidOnDate  DateTime2011 10 30,2,45185
1931,However Id like to use the useful xerophp wrapper if possible,1,45185
1932,After reading the github page and various discussions on here as well as the code it looks to me as if the filter I should be setting is as follows ie the value of the array item is itself an array made up of operand literal value,0,45185
1933,aFilter  arraytDate  arrayDateTime2013 06 01tDate  arrayDateTime2013 06 30result  xeroInvoicesaFilter,2,45185
1934,However this results in the following errorArray    ErrorNumber  16    Type  QueryParseException    Message  Operator  incompatible with operand types DateTime and String,1,45185
1935,Also of course as the field name is the array key I only end up with one array item not two as you can see in the array dump,1,45185

1940,COZYROC is the leading provider of thirdparty components for Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services,0,46680
1941,We have recently included adapters which support the Xero application,0,46680

1944,Hi all Im a newbie web developer and also new to xero api,0,45763
1945,What I am asking is simple How to create the function for a GETPOST request for invoices,3,45763
1946,I have looked at the api previwer understand the xml but not how to implement the run button function,1,45763
1947,Any sample code to look at including a submit button,3,45763
1948,I have been uploading Timesheets to Xero successfully in an application in C for over 12 months,0,44963
1949,With the latest revision of the app no changes to the codeline used for the Timesheets upload I am no longer able to do the uploads and am getting a BadRequest exception raised,1,44963
1950,The detail merely shows A validation exception occurred,1,44963
1951,I have the ApiTimesheetsCreate in a trycatch block with three separate catch blocks,0,44963
1952,The first of these iscatch XeroApiInfrastructureExceptionValidationException vEbut this is not trapping,1,44963
1953,The second catch block is for BadRequestException and that traps,0,44963
1954,How can I then determine the actual Validation errors,3,44963
1955,The full ValidationException block containsterrStore  Validation errors from xerorntforeach var v in vEValidationErrorsttterrStore  vMessage  rnttAppGlobalsloggerErrorError TS Upload error  vMessage  rnt,1,44963
1956,but with that not being trapped how can I find the errors,3,44963
1957,Why does the BadRequest exception supersede the ValidationException or are there multiple exceptions occurring,3,44963
1958,It makes life fairly difficult when my client cannot determine what has gone wrong without my having to get into debug mode on a production system,1,44963
1961,I want to test my application against different scenarios so it will be great if we can induce token expiration instead of having to wait 30 minutes for it to systematically expire,1,46916
1962,I am using a public application and official PHP Xero API wrapper,0,46916
1963,Thanks,4,46916
1964,Why is it that Xero will not accept an email address with numeric characters in the TLD either by API or manual Contact entry,3,44426
1965,There are TLDs which have numeric character in them listed on IANA  httpdataianaorgTLDtldsalphabydomaintxt  scroll down to XN domains,0,44426
1966,encoded as xnmgberp4a5d4ar alSaudiah in Arabic Scriptwhich is registered to the Saudi Network Information Centre,0,44426
1967,I get thrown this error via APIError 10 ValidationException A validation exception occurred Email address must be valid Email address must be valid,1,44426
1968,Thanks,4,44426
1969,HiI have a web app that requires invoicing inventory and payroll access to insert timesheets,0,46159
1970,Have got it working using the core api Version 2  have got hold of the payroll DotNet sample which looks to be the same as the core api sample with a console payroll section,0,46159
1971,Anyway the example doesnt show the situation where I wan to use both apisie I want to process invoices using the core api and then turn the page to payroll and insert timesheets,1,46159
1972,Do I have to log out of 1 and log into the other,3,46159
1973,Can I use the same access token to create both payroll and core repositories,3,46159
1974,Any examples of the above in DotNet,3,46159
1975,First scenarioI am using the PUT method to create an invoice in Xero,0,45385
1976,I have an issue with the lineAmount when a CurrencyRate apply,1,45385
1977,This is one of my LineItems in my Invoice XMLLineItemtDescription EDGA01INVBE3983TraveltLineAmount 66201300tTaxAmount 00000tAccountCode RET300tCurrency fields as part of the Invoice XMLCurrencyCode USDCurrencyRate 00743The lineItem in the response from XERO looked like this for the above line item          Description EDGA01INVBE3983Travel          UnitAmount 6620          TaxType NONE          TaxAmount 000          LineAmount 6620          AccountCode RET300          Tracking           Quantity 10000          LineItemID 732ca155e1bc4fe0bb77504f25540034          ValidationErrors ,2,45385
1978,Why does the LineAmount change to 6620 does XERO only accepts 2 decimal points,3,45385
1979,Second scenarioI decided to send through the lineAmount with 2 decimal points,0,45385
1980,This is one of my LineItems in my Invoice XMLLineItemtDescription ILLI11INVBE3985SetuptLineAmount 22425tTaxAmount 000tAccountCode ASC400Currency fields as part of the Invoice XMLCurrencyCode EURCurrencyRate 00690,2,45385
1981,So according to my understanding Xero should do a reverse calculation for the value in the Revenue account 22425  00690  R325000 but instead the Revenue account reports R324999,1,45385
1982,HiI am trying to modify a paid invoice by changing the accountcode for given line item I can modified unpaid invoice with out a problem,0,45515
1983,However once the payment exist I receive the error Invoice not of valid status for modificationWhich makes sense however I was hoping since I am able to change the item account code easily on the web UI even if an payment has been created    that I could do the same thing via the API,1,45515
1984,Any ideas are highly appreciatedthank youJacob,4,45515

1990,At what time does the count reset,3,45329
1991,Is this relative to the API token you are using and when this is created or is it every 0000UTC or at some other time,3,45329
1992,Id like to track the API calls we make to ensure we throttle properly so we never hit the limit however thats difficult to program unless I know when the API limits are reset,1,45329

1999,With a payment that is part of a bulk payment this returns the first purchase invoice associated with the bulk payment rather than the correct purchase invoice,1,45181

2002,Hi thereFirstly apologies if this is in the wrong place,0,45011
2003,There were at least 3 possible places this question couldve been created but I figured as Im using wrapper code it should go here,0,45011
2004,Im using the NET Xero API SDK 2020 in CIm trying to send an invoice to a customer upon payment,0,45011
2005,It should be sent with the invoice in a paid state so there is no confusion,0,45011
2006,Ive got the code down good to apply the payment to the invoice and sending the email goes fine,0,45011
2007,But then when we try to update the invoice to say its been sent out I get the following validation errors Invoice not of valid status for modification This document cannot be edited as it has a payment or credit note allocated to it,1,45011
2008,Here is some of the code Im using t bits and bobs to get the payment madetprivateAppApiPaymentsCreatepaymenttEmailInvoicepaymenttUpdateXeroInvoiceSentToContactpaymentInvoiceprivate void UpdateXeroInvoiceSentToContactXeroModelsInvoice invoicetinvoiceSentToContact  truetprivateAppApiInvoicesUpdateinvoice,2,45011
2009,Any ideas of how this couldshould be handled,3,45011
2010,I thought about trying to set the sent status first then applying the payment and then sending the email The problem with this approach is that Id get caught out again if something went wrong sending the email I wouldnt then be able to set SentToContact to false because a payment has been applied Which doesnt feel quite right,1,45011
2011,Any help appreciatedCheersCraig,4,45011
2012,I am trying to work out the best way to update an existing Timesheet Australian Payroll API without replacing or overwriting the existing TimesheetLines,0,45868
2013,At the moment when POSTING and specifying the TimesheetID the existing TimesheetLines are lost,1,45868
2014,Also if the Timesheet is Approved then you can no longer POST to it,1,45868
2015,Having to rePOST the entire TimesheetLines content seems odd,1,45868
2016,Suggestions very welcome,4,45868
2017,We have developed an integration between our software a Net Winforms application with Xero        allowing the user to import revenue and expense transactions using the API into our software,0,46784
2018,At the moment every time the user wants to execute this import from within our software they are presented with a Xero authentication page         where they enter in the username and password and then on a second page select the â€˜organisationâ€™ they want to allow our software to access    screenshot  httpswwwscreencastcomtJCwxMns3bW8 ,0,46784
2019,I see that there is an â€˜Allow access for 30 minsâ€™ option which saves them from having to login multiple times however it still always prompts the user during this 30min period to select the Xero organisation,1,46784
2020,Is it possible for us to capture and store their Xero username  password and the organisation that they have originally selected within our software so we can programmatically use them in the future,3,46784
2021,So each time they would want to execute an import they wonâ€™t have to login or select their organisation again Is this possible to do with Xero,4,46784
2022,Our AffinityLive product allows users to record expenses against a project,0,46210
2023,In some cases they may not be personal expenses but ones paid for already by a business credit card or chequebook etc,0,46210
2024,We are wondering if these expenses can be pushed through to Xero via the API,3,46210
2025,My understanding is that these are not Expense Claims assigned to a user but are more general business expenses which are recorded differently,1,46210
2026,Were a bit lost on how to proceed  part of the problem of course is that were not accountants and may be taking the wrong approach,1,46210
2027,Appreciate any advice,4,46210
